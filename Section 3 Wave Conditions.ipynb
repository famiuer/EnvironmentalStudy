    "For quasi-static response of structures, it is sufficient to use deterministic regular waves characterized by wave length and corresponding wave period, wave height and crest height. The deterministic wave parameters may be predicted by statistical methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structures with significant dynamic response require stochastic modelling of the sea surface and its kinematics by time series. A sea state is specified by a wave frequency spectrum with a given significant wave height, a representative frequency, a mean propagation direction and a spreading function. In applications the sea state is usually assumed to be a stationary random process. Three hours has been introduced as a standard time between registrations of sea states when measuring waves, but the period of stationarity can range from 30 minutes to 10 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wave conditions in a sea state can be divided into two categories: wind seas and swell. Wind seas are generated by local wind, while swell have no relationship to the local wind. Swells are waves that have travelled out of the areas where they were generated. Note that several swell components may be present at a given location.\n",
